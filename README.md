# Habitat-Suitability
Final project for Earth Analytics AY24.

Instructions: The notebooks are designed to be run in numerical order. 
If different National Forests are to be analyzed, select for them in the fourth cell of 
01-boundaries.ipynb and add the GeoDataFrame to the site list in the same cell. Plot titles in 
07-results.ipynb will need to be altered by hand.


## Future Tasks:
* Fix harmonization of data sets for Jefferson National Forest.
* Improve visual plot labels
* Consolidate defined functions to the scripts file.
* Establish pipeline to save climate data to the data directory.
* Improve function docstrings.
* Improve comments throughout analysis.
* Loop through elevation data arrays to construct plots
* Improve run times by saving processed raster data to the data directory before model construction.
